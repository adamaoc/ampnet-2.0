					<p>Holiday-Design is an online store that sells seasonal and holiday decorations. One of their main focuses was to have an easy to use shopping cart where they could add inventory and have it displayed not just on their website, but also on Facebook. We made that happen by integrating a smart and well-known shopping cart. The site itself had to be responsive, so we chose to go with Bootstrap 3 as a base framework. Inventory is pulled in using the shopping cart's API so that we can keep the look, feel, and responsiveness our client needed. <a href="http://holiday-design.com" target="_blank">checkout the site &raquo;</a></p>
