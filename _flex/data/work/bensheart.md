Ben's Heart Foundation is one of the first sites I developed on the [FlexHub](http://flexhub.ampnetmedia.com) platform for [ORG-Websites](http://org-websites.com). This is a great non-profit that helps families in the DFW area who have children born with heart abnormalities. I helped them get the website started up as well as a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

This site is built out on a template using `PHP`, `HTML`, and `Sass` and has been optimized for top-notch SEO. All editing is done through the FlexHub backend tooling so the customer can easily edit content and sections on the page. This is one of our most affordable and fastest websites to go to production.
