txGarage is an online, automotive magazine that features news and reviews and is focused on a Texas audience. This site needed to be able to scale well and has gone through 3 redesigns in the 5 years as clients with ampnet(media). We built this site using the WordPress framework giving them a clean and vibrant custom theme that really shows off their skills of reviewing and photographing automobiles. They are also deeply integrated into many social networks to help draw traffic.
